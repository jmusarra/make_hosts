This generates a host file from a spreadsheet. The only constraints are that 
the spreadsheet needs sheets named "ARCH_LTG IP", "PROD_LTG IP", and 
"ARCH_CTRL IP", and those sheets must have columns named "IP ADDRESS" and 
"DEVICE ID".
All other columns will be ignored, and rows that have blank cells in either of 
those two columns will be ignored.
This will OVERWRITE any existing hosts files! If you want to make edits, you 
can do that in the spreadsheet and re-run, or do it in a text editor (notepad) 
or the Powertoys 'Hosts File Editor':
